<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Welcome to my Github blog. In this introductory post, I’ll explain what the purpose of this is and what I use Github for.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What This Is</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is the first of many posts about my software development projects.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’ve been a Github user for many years and have a few projects set up on it, which I’ll go into more detail about shortly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’ll be sharing some details on these projects, such as things I have learned and challenges I’ve had.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>My Projects</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Here’s a bit of information about the projects I’ve stored on Github.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">umpire: This is a web-based tool for analysing data for a local football league’s umpires. They use it to see how many games umpires have officiated with other umpires, for each club and team, and so on. It helps them plan their upcoming assignments.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">citpsql: This is the project to contain all of the SQL files that I use for my website, Database Star. It includes function code for functions such as <a href=‘https://www.databasestar.com/oracle-listagg/'>LISTAGG</a>, as well as database setup and object code for other posts such as my in-depth guide to <a href=“https://www.databasestar.com/oracle-sql-indexes”>Oracle indexes</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Future</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What do I plan on doing with this in the future?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have a long list of projects and limited time, so whenever I decide to create a new project then I’ll be using Github to store and manage the source code for it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s the occasional checking of umpire code and other code for Database Star until that happens.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Until next time,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
